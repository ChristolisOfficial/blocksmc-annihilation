# BlocksMC Annihilation
![Header](https://github.com/ChristolisOfficial/blocksmc-annihilation/blob/master/res/header.png)
This is an abandoned project that was programmed by **ChristolisOfficial** and produced by **DeZiMatorZ** for the *BlocksMC server*. It was cancelled due to the producer having massive disagreements with the producer, and because the programmer lost his developer position in that server one day before this project was cancelled. You can still find and play in the *BlocksMC server*, by connecting to the IP `blocks.com`(for cracked users) or `premium.blocksmc.com`(for premium players).
